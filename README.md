# CookieCatSpaceAdventure
This is a Pascal course project from my freshman year at college.
Made in Free Pascal. With original sprite animations in 8-bit retro
style.

Use purpose:

An entertaining short 8-bit style game about a cat named CookieCat,
saving Space from Snack Invaders. Loosely inspired by an ice cream mascot
from an animated tv series 'Steven's Universe'.

Main menu

In the main menu the user can start a new game, continue a previous one
or click on 'ranking' button to see the top 10 players' in-game scores.

Player scores

The player rankings are displayed in the 'ranking' section of the menu
and are written and read from a .txt file.

Sound on/off

The button with a 'loudspeaker' icon is a on/off background music toggle.

Gameplay 

After choosing a new game, the main gamewindow appears. The user controls
the game character with arrow keys and can shoot ice cream at the enemies 
by spamming spacebar. 

Character's HP meter is measured in cookies - once all of the 3 cookies are
broken, it's game over.

The game points counter is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen
and renews with each successfull hit to the enemies.

The enemies come in 'waves'. Each time one is hit with a cookie thrown by the
main character, the point counter goes up.

Once all of the enemies are defeated, the game is cleared fully.

Enemies

There are 3 types of 'Snack' enemies:
-Pizza
-Candy
-Cookie Spider

Each enemy moves in a different patten.
Back and forth, Horisontally or in a circle.

If an enemy touches the main character sprite, the health of the character will
go down.

Endings

There are multiple endings to this game:
-GAME OVER is when the main character runs out of health.
-VICTORY is when the main character gets rid of all the enemy 'waves'.
